LeetCode #217

O(nlog(n)) (Timsort), but saves memory:

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        nums = sorted(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
                return True
        return False



Bad:

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:        
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):

                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    return True
        return False



Good, O(n) space and O(n) time:

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) == len(set(nums)):  # This, set(nums), causes O(n) space and time.
            return False
        return True

Good, O(n) time and O(1) space:

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        return dict(Counter(s)) == dict(Counter(t))
        
        
        
Why this, similar to the previous, is O(1) space? Only if we exclude the space of inputs, strings s and t,
thus taking the auxiliary space equals O(1), but also we have to assume that there is a fixed number of characters
from which s and t could be composed. If that number is potentially infinite, the dictionaries space rises to O(n).

To be precise, the solution has the time complexity of O(s + t):

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        a = {}
        b = {}
        for i in s:
            if i not in a:
                a[i] = 1
            else:
                a[i] += 1
        for i in t:
            if i not in b:
                b[i] = 1
            else:
                b[i] += 1
        return a == b
        
        
        
Using Timsort, O(nlog(n)) time and O(n) space:

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

We are not allowed to use the same index many times. However, the same two numbers could add up to the target only if 
they are of different indexes.

The trick is to search for (target - n) inside a hashmap. Seems like an easy 'observation' (insight). However, while we are 
searching for the difference, we don't want to iterate over the whole hashmap because there is a case where the same two 
numbers could add up to the target, so the loop would return two identical indexes, which is forbidden. Therefore, we will
loop through the array, but we will check if (target - n) exists in the subarray omitting this part of the array upon which 
we already iterated.

By searching for (target - n) we are also checking if n exists and we have the index of n at our disposal via using a hashmap.


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if target - n in seen:
                return [i, seen[target - n]]
            else:
                seen[n] = i
