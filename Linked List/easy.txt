LeetCode #206
-------------


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next


# Solution with pointers. O(n) time, O(1) space. A simple drawing:

| | s
  1-2-3-4
  
We should store (s) the next of the current pointer (on 1). That should be done before moving the current pointer 
and assigning its next attribute to the value of the previous pointer (on the drawing, it points to None).


class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        while curr:  # curr will eventually get to None (next attribute is set to None by default.)
            s = curr.next  # We stor it, so that curr = s.
            curr.next = prev  # next backwards... we need prev for this.
            prev = curr  # prev to curr, curr to...
            curr = s  # the stored s.
        return prev
