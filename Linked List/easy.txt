LeetCode #206

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next


# Solution with pointers. O(n) time, O(1) space. A simple drawing:

| | s
  1-2-3-4
  
We should store (s) the next of the current pointer (on 1). That should be done before moving the current pointer 
and assigning its next attribute to the value of the previous pointer (on the drawing, it points to None).


class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        while curr:  # curr will eventually get to None (next attribute is set to None by default.)
            s = curr.next  # We store it, so that curr = s.
            curr.next = prev  # next backwards... we need prev for this.
            prev = curr  # prev to curr, curr to...
            curr = s  # the stored s.
        return prev

LeetCode #21

Merge two lists. They do not have to be linked. Two pointers solution but the left doesn't move and it is used to reference the head
via left.next, since if we don't have the head, we don't have the full (merged) list. left can be called a placeholder. 

To be specific, we use four pointers in total, including list1 and list2 as two heads. So actually, what make those lists linked lists 
are the lines:

list1 = list1.next
list2 = list2.next

because these two pointers, i.e. the heads: list1 and list2, are referencing the next node which is of the least higher value.


class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        left = ListNode()  # Dummy node. The head will be left.next.
        right = left
        while list1 and list2:  # This deals only with the case where both lists are not empty.
            if list1.val < list2.val:
                right.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                right.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            
            right = right.next

        # if list1:
        #     right.next = list1
        # elif list2:
        #     right.next = list2

        right.next = list1 or list2
        
        return left.next
