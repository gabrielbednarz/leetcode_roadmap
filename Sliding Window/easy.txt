LeetCode #121

The sliding window is a potential strategy to solve a problems that ask for an optimal subsequence. The sliding window involves two pointers (l and r).
The essence: if l > r, update both (we don't buy and sell at the same time); if l < r, update r (search for higher price). For every case in which l < r,
calculate the current max profit, store it, and return the global maximum.


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = 1
        curr_max = 0
        while r < len(prices):
            if prices[l] >= prices[r]:
                l = r  # Inefficient or could not find the local maximum if l += 1.
                       # Compare: prices = [1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0,9].
                r += 1  # Search for bigger number.
            else:
                curr_max = max(curr_max, prices[r] - prices[l])
                r += 1  # Search for bigger number.
        return curr_max
